Part A steps: 

1. copy over using cp
2. submit job using sbatch - sbatch sweep_bondbreak.sh
3. check status = jobperf ${jobuuid_from_step2} sacct, queue
3. analyze outputs of output file genereated from script

Part B steps:
1. Get time taken to run script from sacct - 13 mins 9 seconds
2. add GNU parallel code to for loop
3. submit to sched using sbatch - sbatch sweep+bondbrak.sh
4. new time taken - 28 seconds
