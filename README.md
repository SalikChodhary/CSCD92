# Development/Testing

Run ```make``` in the root directory, should generate an output file named ```output``` in each exercise directory.
Run ```make clean``` to clear the output files.

# WIP:
Modularized, sub-directory level makefile's, to allow further customization per exercise.
This simple makefile does the job for now but does not make full use of makefiles, by not using intermediate .o files.
